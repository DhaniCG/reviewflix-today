            <p>Effective Date: 07/01/20</p>
            <p>
                The following Privacy Policy governs the online information collection
                practices of reviewflixtoday.com. ("we" or "us"). Specifically, it
                outlines the types of information that we gather about you while you
                are using the reviewflixtoday.com website (the "Site"), and the ways
                in which we use this information. This Privacy Policy, including our
                children's privacy statement, does not apply to any information you
                may provide to us or that we may collect offline and/or through other
                means (for example, at a live event, via telephone, or through the
                mail).
            </p>
            <p>
                Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By visiting and using the
                Site, you agree that your use of our Site, and any dispute over
                privacy, is governed by this Privacy Policy. Because the Web is an
                evolving medium, we may need to change our Privacy Policy at some
                point in the future, in which case we'll post the changes to this
                Privacy Policy on this website and update the Effective Date of the
                policy to reflect the date of the changes. By continuing to use the
                Site after we post any such changes, you accept the Privacy Policy as
                modified.
            </p>
            <h3>How We Collect and Use Information</h3>
            <p>
                We may collect and store personal or other information that you
                voluntarily supply to us online while using the Site (e.g., while on
                the Site or in responding via email to a feature provided on the
                Site).
            </p>
            <p>
                reviewflixtoday.com only contacts individuals who specifically
                request that we do so or in the event that they have signed up to
                receive our free newsletters or have purchased one of our products.
            </p>
            <p>
                reviewflixtoday.com collects personally identifying information from
                our users during online registration and online purchasing. Generally,
                this information includes name and e-mail address for registration to
                receive our free newsletters and name, postal address, and credit card
                information when purchasing our products. All of this information is
                provided to us by you.
            </p>
            <p>
                We also collect and store information that is generated automatically
                as you navigate online through the Site. For example, we may collect
                information about your computer's connection to the Internet, which
                allows us, among other things, to improve the delivery of our web
                pages to you and to measure traffic on the Site. We also may use a
                standard feature found in browser software called a "cookie" to
                enhance your experience with the Site. Cookies are small files that
                your web browser places on your hard drive for record-keeping
                purposes. By showing how and when visitors use the Site, cookies help
                us deliver advertisements, identify how many unique users visit us,
                and track user trends and patterns. They also prevent you from having
                to re-enter your preferences on certain areas of the Site where you
                may have entered preference information before. The Site also may use
                web beacons (single-pixel graphic files also known as "transparent
                GIFs") to access cookies and to count users who visit the Site or open
                HTML-formatted email messages.
            </p>
            <p>
                We use the information we collect from you while you are using the
                Site in a variety of ways, including using the information to
                customize features and advertising that appear on the Site. We also
                may provide your information to third parties, such as service
                providers and contractors, for a variety of purposes. Unless you
                inform us in accordance with the process described below, we reserve
                the right to use, and to disclose to third parties, all of the
                information collected from and about you while you are using the Site
                in any way and for any purpose, such as to enable us or a third party
                to provide you with information about products and services. If you do
                not wish your information to be used for these purposes, you must send
                a letter to the Online Privacy Coordinator whose address is listed at
                the end of this Privacy Policy requesting to be taken off any lists of
                information that may be used for these purposes or that may be given
                or sold to third-parties. Please keep in mind that whenever you
                voluntarily make your personal information available for viewing by
                third parties online - for example on message boards, web logs,
                through email, or in chat areas - that information can be seen,
                collected and used by others besides us. We cannot be responsible for
                any unauthorized third-party use of such information.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some of our third-party advertisers and ad servers that place and
                present advertising on the Site also may collect information from you
                via cookies, web beacons or similar technologies. These third-party
                advertisers and ad servers may use the information they collect to
                help present their advertisements, to help measure and research the
                advertisements' effectiveness, or for other purposes. The use and
                collection of your information by these third-party advertisers and ad
                servers is governed by the relevant third-party's privacy policy and
                is not covered by our Privacy Policy. Indeed, the privacy policies of
                these third-party advertisers and ad servers may be different from
                ours. If you have any concerns about a third party's use of cookies or
                web beacons or use of your information, you should visit that party's
                website and review its privacy policy. The Site also includes links to
                other websites and provides access to products and services offered by
                third parties, whose privacy policies we do not control. When you
                access another website or purchase third-party products or services
                through the Site, use of any information you provide is governed by
                the privacy policy of the operator of the site you are visiting or the
                provider of such products or services.
            </p>
            <p>
                We may also make some content, products and services available through
                our Site through cooperative relationships with third-party providers,
                where the brands of our provider partner appear on the Site in
                connection with such content, products and/or services. We may share
                with our provider partner any information you provide, or that is
                collected, in the course of visiting any pages that are made available
                in cooperation with our provider partner. In some cases, the provider
                partner may collect information from you directly, in which cases the
                privacy policy of our provider partner may apply to the provider
                partner's use of your information. The privacy policy of our provider
                partners may differ from ours. If you have any questions regarding the
                privacy policy of one of our provider partners, you should contact the
                provider partner directly for more information.
            </p>
            <p>
                Be aware that we may occasionally release information about our
                visitors when release is appropriate to comply with law or to protect
                the rights, property or safety of users of the Site or the public.
            </p>
            <p>
                Please also note that as our business grows, we may buy or sell
                various assets. In the event that we sell some or all of our assets,
                or one or more of our websites is acquired by another company,
                information about our users may be among the transferred assets.

            <h3>Your Choices Regarding Communications</h3>
            <p>
                We believe in giving you control over communications you receive. You
                may opt out of having your data collected from this browser on this
                device for the purpose of receiving email or telephone communications.
                In connection with your use of reviewflixtoday.com, we may send you
                service announcements, administrative messages, marketing
                communications, and other information. You may opt out of some of any
                electronic communications, for example, by clicking on the
                “unsubscribe” link in marketing e-mails or disabling notifications for
                SMS Services in your mobile phone or tablet settings. Please be aware
                that there may be a brief period before we are able to process your
                opt-out, but we will always respect your legal rights to opt out of
                receiving unwanted messages.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some of our Services utilize SMS, which may cause you to incur SMS or
                data charges with your wireless provider. Please be aware that we have
                no control over these charges, and if you do not wish to be charged,
                you should stop using the SMS features of the Services.
            </p>
            <h3>Children's Privacy Statement</h3>
            <p>
                This children's privacy statement explains our practices with respect
                to the online collection and use of personal information from children
                under the age of thirteen, and provides important information
                regarding their rights under federal law with respect to such
                information.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    This Site is not directed to children under the age of thirteen and
                    we do NOT knowingly collect personally identifiable information from
                    children under the age of thirteen as part of the Site. We screen
                    users who wish to provide personal information in order to prevent
                    users under the age of thirteen from providing such information. If
                    we become aware that we have inadvertently received personally
                    identifiable information from a user under the age of thirteen as
                    part of the Site, we will delete such information from our records.
                    If we change our practices in the future, we will obtain prior,
                    verifiable parental consent before collecting any personally
                    identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen as
                    part of the Site.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Because we do not collect any personally identifiable information
                    from children under the age of thirteen as part of the Site, we also
                    do NOT knowingly distribute such information to third parties.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We do NOT knowingly allow children under the age of thirteen to
                    publicly post or otherwise distribute personally identifiable
                    contact information through the Site.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Because we do not collect any personally identifiable information
                    from children under the age of thirteen as part of the Site, we do
                    NOT condition the participation of a child under thirteen in the
                    Site's online activities on providing personally identifiable
                    information.
